# 🛡️ Beyond the Firewall: Human-Centric Threat Modeling for the Age of Social Engineering

This repository contains the full manuscript of my cybersecurity research paper, which introduces the **Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Threat Model** — a novel framework for modeling and defending against social engineering attacks that exploit human behavior, psychology, and organizational process gaps.

## 🧠 Abstract

> Traditional threat modeling focuses on technical vulnerabilities — code flaws, system misconfigurations, and network protocols. This paper argues that such models are no longer sufficient. The primary attack vector in modern breaches has shifted from technical exploits to **human manipulation**.
>
> Through a comparative case study of the Twitter (2020), Uber (2022), and MGM Resorts (2023) breaches, we propose the **Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Threat Model**, a structured methodology for mapping and mitigating human-centric threats such as vishing, pretexting, and MFA fatigue.
